    "An FX American option gives the option holder the right to enter into an FX forward contract with maturity $T$. The option can be exercised at any time prior to the option expiry date $T_e$. In contrast, an FX European option gives the option holder the right to enter into the same FX forward contract only on the option expiry date $T_e$. If the American option holder decided to hold the option until the option expiry date, the American option is equivalent to the European option. The price of the American option should therefore be no less than the price of an FX European option. "

    "For the European option holder to replication the early exercised American option, at the early exercise time $t$ he can short the forward contract at zero cost. His portfolio is then short foward and long an European option. This portfolio's value at time $T$ is $F_t - F_T + \\max(F_T - K, 0) \\geq F_t - K$.
